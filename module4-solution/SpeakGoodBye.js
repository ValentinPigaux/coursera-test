// NOTE! The steps in this file are basically identical to the ones you
// performed in the SpeakHello.js file.

// STEP 6: Wrap the entire contents of SpeakGoodBye.js inside of an IIFE
// See Lecture 52, part 2

(function (window) {
// STEP 7: Create an object, called 'byeSpeaker' to which you will attach
// the "speak" method and which you will expose to the global context
// See Lecture 52, part 1
// var byeSpeaker =

byeSpeaker.speak = function(name) {
  console.log(speakWord + " " + name);

var speakWord = "Good Bye";

// STEP 4: Rewrite the 'speak' function such that it is attached to the
// helloSpeaker object instead of being a standalone function.
// See Lecture 52, part 2


// STEP 5: Expose the 'helloSpeaker' object to the global scope. Name it
// 'helloSpeaker' on the global scope as well.
// See Lecture 52, part 2
// (Note, Step 6 will be done in the SpeakGoodBye.js file.)
